# The Mono-White Commander Tierlist
Here is a structured tierlist of all the playable commander(s) in mono-white, with detailed explanations of why they are ranked as they are.
Partners will be rated individually because I'm not going to bother to put 56 combinations on this list, and no, Rograkh is not in mono-white.

## Tier 0
Here would be the commanders that are so good that no other mono-white commander would be even remotely comparable in power level. However for mono-white to have such a commander would require a WWWWW costing creature with an enters the battlefield trigger of 'win the game'.

## Tier 1
Explanation of Tier 1


#### <a href="">Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle</a>


## Tier 2
Explanation of Tier 2
These are all commanders I would generally call 'good'. 

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/18/heliod-sun-crowned">Heliod, Sun-Crowned</a>
A controversial take to put it a tier lower than Teshar

#### <a href="">Sram, Senior Edificer</a> 





#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nem/12/lin-sivvi-defiant-hero">Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero</a> 


#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/16/god-eternal-oketra">God-Eternal Oketra</a> 


#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/7/hokori-dust-drinker">Hokori, Dust Drinker</a> 


#### <a href="">Yosei, the Morning Star</a> 


## Tier 3
Explanation of Tier 3

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/3/celestial-kirin">Celestial Kirin</a> 
Mostly up here because of Ugin's Conjurant being easily tutorable flexible mass removal that can hit lands. Awkwardness can happen between spirits in hand and your boardstate, but when Kirin works it feels pretty unfair to your opponents as every card in your hand is removing multiple of their permanents.

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/9/darien-king-of-kjeldor">Darien, King of Kjeldor</a> 
While Darien can both generate value on his own and is a combo win condition his high mana cost and requirement of playing bad combo pieces make him clunkier than ideal. That said Darien still does both of those things fairly reasonably.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/9/daxos-blessed-by-the-sun">Daxos, Blessed by the Sun</a> 
Soul sisters combos in commander aren't great but when one piece of the combo is in the command zone the combo looks more appealing. Daxos can only get better with time as new cards get printed.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/hou/10/djeru-with-eyes-open">Djeru, With Eyes Open</a> 
This gets some of the better cards available in mono-white, and that's it. One of the better commanders to play if you want to cast Triumphant Reckoning.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/7/eight-and-a-half-tails">Eight-and-a-Half-Tails</a> 
A decent protection ability which can make it hard for your opponents to stop whatever you want to do. Unfortunately this makes the deck very mana-intensive which means sacrifices need to be made in other areas.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/18/elesh-norn-grand-cenobite">Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite</a> 
Shuts off many decks single-handedly and stops many on-board combos, while making your hate pieces a good bit more threatening since you have an effective +4/+4 anthem for creature combat.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/15/halvar-god-of-battle-sword-of-the-realms">Halvar, God of Battle</a> 

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ths/17/heliod-god-of-the-sun">Heliod, God of the Sun</a> 
Feeds the ever-hungry Skullclamp, lets your beaters and hatepieces beat without you dying in retaliation, and is hard to remove
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/13/kentaro-the-smiling-cat">Kentaro, the Smiling Cat</a> 
This fixes your mana in a mono-color deck. Play with heavy irony.
On a more serious note, Kentaro goes infinite with fairly little effort but does nothing on his own which is why he's a Tier lower than other combo generals like Lin Sivvi.
#### <a href="">Sensei Golden-Tail</a> 
Same as the above, but tastes different.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri, the Lithomancer</a>
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri</a> does enough interesting things recurring bigger equipments and providing sacrifice fodder for <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/309/smokestack">Smokestack</a> to be a contender.

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/31/livio-oathsworn-sentinel">Livio, Oathsworn Sentinel</a> 
Livio does a lot of sweet things, though admittedly none are individually particularly powerful. Between reusing enters/leaves the battlefield triggers, protecting your creatures from a boardwipe (in a roundabout way), or setting up combos, Livio is strangely flexible for a white card in a very good way.

#### <a href="">Rebbec, Architect of Asension</a> 
Rebbec has a good ability but currently doesn't have the best home in mono-white as she can make your boardstate awkward between equipment and artifact creatures, both of which are used a good amount of in mono-white. If no such issue exists in the deck then she's the second best partner after Livio.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/18/losheel-clockwork-scholar">Losheel, Clockwork Scholar</a>
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/27/mangara-the-diplomat">Mangara, the Diplomat</a> 
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/stx/21/mavinda-students-advocate">Mavinda, Students' Advocate</a>
#### <a href=""></a>
#### <a href=""></a>
#### <a href=""></a>

## Tier 4
Explanation of Tier 4

These are commanders that are strong in specific metas, or have potential to be good in the future but currently lack the ability to consistently do powerful things due to the lack of support. These are by no means well-rounded good commanders, but may be considered.
Even bad partners will be in here as they each have their own merits since there's less opportunity cost to playing them.

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/2/akroma-vision-of-ixidor">Akroma, Vision of Ixidor</a> 
While Akroma could and should be far better than she is, she's a mana sink that will spook your opponents into playing around her will.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/4/alharu-solemn-ritualist">Alharu, Solemn Ritualist</a> 
With enough +1/+1 support this can become a small engine (if not go infinite) in the command zone as a partner. As it stands Alharu is mostly there to make some tokens that will have incidental synergy with the deck.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/2/anafenza-kin-tree-spirit">Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit</a> 
If Persist comes back as a mechanic you could fairly easily combo off with Anafenza, but for now this is not true.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/10/ardenn-intrepid-archaeologist">Ardenn, Intrepid Archaeologist</a> 
Best if you can curve an equipment that grants protection into Ardenn, but there's only a handful of such equipment, and you'd be better off ramping early. That said as a partner he can save you mana in the long run by "paying" equip costs even though you can't distribute your equipments as you want.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/8/avacyn-angel-of-hope">Avacyn, Angel of Hope</a> 
While her ability can combine with other cards to end games, her casting cost is so high that your opponents will generally have counterplay to whatever you try to threaten them with.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c17/2/balan-wandering-knight">Balan, Wandering Knight</a> 
There's a timeline where there are enough cheap and powerful equipment, and ways to dump a bunch into play fast, to where this can do lethal to each opponent very fast. However we do not live in this timeline. That said he is difficult to remove without the use of mass removal as his ability can be activated multiple times to make sure no single target removal connects with him (assuming you have protective equipment in play).
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/emn/15a/bruna-the-fading-light">Bruna, the Fading Light</a> 
Recurs two good creature types in the color _on cast_, and can shut off a lot of what your opponents can do if you find Gisela. Only limiting factor is her mana cost, but it's a fair price to pay for the ability to go long and grind out games.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tsr/15/crovax-ascendant-hero">Crovax, Ascendant Hero</a> 
A worse Elesh Norn is still somewhat decent as Crovax can shut off some on-board creature combos and has the potential to cripple opponents. I can't really see a reason to play this over Elesh Norn other than as an aesthetic choice.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/370/danitha-capashen-paragon">Danitha Capashen, Paragon</a> 
There might be a weird deck where you storm off with Auras and Equipments some day that involves Danitha Capashen and Sram, but this would require new cards or a Paradox Engine unban. Without this missing enabler she can dump a hand of equipments and auras fast and won't die in combat thanks to first strike.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/16/evra-halcyon-witness">Evra, Halcyon Witness</a> 
Evra can kill your opponents very fast given certain conditions, although I wouldn't hold out hope for it.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/emn/28/gisela-the-broken-blade">Gisela, the Broken Blade</a> 
If there were a fast way to cheat Bruna onto the field then Gisela could be powerful. However white lacks Entomb, and Gisela does not recur creatures like Bruna does so she is the worse option of the pair. That said, she is an efficient threat.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/19/hixus-prison-warden">Hixus, Prison Warden</a> 
Removal in the command zone. In some weird meta of whi Hixus could put in work but for most games you'd rather have something else.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/20/iona-shield-of-emeria">Iona, Shield of Emeria</a> 
In most cases Iona's effect is mediocre, and hate pieces need to be pretty backbreaking for them to warrant play in the command zone. Even worse is the massive 6WWW casting cost.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c17/62/jazal-goldmane">Jazal Goldmane</a> 
This is a weird Craterhoof Behemoth that can threaten table lethal fairly fast, the issue remains keeping your board intact through Toxic Deluges and Cyclonic Rifts.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mma/20/kataki-wars-wage">Kataki, War's Wage</a> 
In a completely artifact centric meta, Kataki will wreak havoc. Outside of that you should be playing less situationally good cards in the command zone.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/28/keleth-sunmane-familiar">Keleth, Sunmane Familiar</a> 
The ability does not matter, what matters is that Keleth draws two cards with Skullclamp. Even funnier is that this isn't even that awful, although having access to Rograkh would be much preferred.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/23/kytheon-hero-of-akros-gideon-battle-forged">Kytheon, Hero of Akros</a> 
Although Kytheon is sometimes hard to flip, he protects both himself and another creature once he has flipped. Long term he makes some boardstates awkward to interact with as he can force a bad attack, or keep hate pieces alive. That said it's mostly just making things awkward rather than making things impossible for your opponents which would be greatly preferred.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/117/lena-selfless-champion">Lena, Selfless Champion</a> 
Aside from going infinite with Nim Deathmantle, Ashnod's Altar, and two nontoken creatures, Lena protects your hate pieces from most mass removal spells. That said going infinite with Lena is a lot slower than other commander options and her second ability is detrimental to doing a combo as she will cost a whopping 8 mana when you need to recast her.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ody/29/lieutenant-kirtar">Lieutenant Kirtar</a> 
If everyone plays Xenagos, God of Revels then Kirtar can protect you. Or you could play removal and a Moat.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/119/linvala-keeper-of-silence">Linvala, Keeper of Silence</a> 

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/26/lyra-dawnbringer">Lyra Dawnbringer</a> 
The comparison to Liesa, Shroud of Dusk makes this card look laughable.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pcy/13/mageta-the-lion">Mageta the Lion</a> 
Mass removal is one of the best things you can do in mono-white, and Mageta provides that in the command zone. Unforunately discarding two cards is a very steep cost for mono-white.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tor/8/major-teroh">Major Teroh</a> 
If everyone else is on black creature decks Teroh is appealing, otherwise don't play this.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tsr/27/mangara-of-corondor">Mangara of Corondor</a> 
Maybe one day there's a very easy way to abuse his effect, but for now it's not easy enough.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/19/michiko-konda-truth-seeker">Michiko Konda, Truth Seeker</a> 
Makes it pretty unappealing to hit you.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/123/mikaeus-the-lunarch">Mikaeus, the Lunarch</a> 
I'd like to think that given enough time Mikaeus can shine. Think in the vein of tapping Mikaeus to put counters on Walking Ballista or Hangarback Walker, but in a more meaningful way.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c20/96/odric-master-tactician">Odric, Master Tactician</a> 
Forcing favorable blocks can be pretty backbreaking against some decks but this ability doesn't apply to enough decks.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/379/odric-lunarch-marshal">Odric, Lunarch Marshal</a> 
Odric would be very solid if he always gave his keywordsoup ability, as is he makes combat a bit tricky for your opponents. I'd generally call him worse than the original.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/21/oketra-the-true">Oketra the True</a> 
With infinite mana you can make an arbitrarily large board and/or draw your deck. However the ways of achieving this are few, of which none are particularly excellent. On her own Oketra2 presents a threat as she wields most equipment well, and can generate a large amount of card advantage very fast if no one can block or remove her. She also eventually kills your opponents which matters less.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/38/prava-of-the-steel-legion">Prava of the Steel Legion</a> 
Similar to Oketra2, if you want to make infinite mana this is one of the few outlets in the command zone. Whereas Oketra2 can wield equipment by herself, Prava is a partner which allows you to select a different angle for your deck building with a partner of your choice.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/40/radiant-archangel">Radiant, Archangel</a> 
If you could get 18 fliers onto the board turn 4 and swing for lethal on turn 5 we might be talking. As is this is very difficult to achieve realistically. Even without that Radiant gets large without much effort and presents an evasive clock on your opponents.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/40/radiant-serra-archangel">Radiant, Serra Archangel</a> 
This is a partner option and having an extra card you can always cast, even if the card is bad, is still relevant. Radiant is also an evasive threat and has one of the best protection types in the game for little extra effort.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/3/regna-the-redeemer">Regna, the Redeemer</a> 
In theory Regna makes 8 tokens a turn cycle, which means a lot of cards drawn with Skullclamp. Unfortunately the mana cost is a bit steep for what is a value generator.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/32/reya-dawnbringer">Reya Dawnbringer</a> 
A very expensive slow value engine. There are metas where this is pretty good but those are far and few between.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/27/rune-tail-kitsune-ascendant-rune-tails-essence">Rune-Tail, Kitsune Asendant</a> 
Makes combat impossible for your opponents when involving you, but ultimately is less useful than it seems.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/36/sephara-skys-blade">Sephara, Sky's Blade</a> 
Big threat for a cheap cost that protects some of your hate pieces from some removal.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/36/thalia-guardian-of-thraben">Thalia, Guardian of Thraben</a> 
Maybe for very degenerate but unrefined metas. Realistically if this card is a good inclusion to face your meta then you should be playing Heliod or Teshar instead and play this in there.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/emn/46/thalia-heretic-cathar">Thalia, Heretic Cathar</a> 
Thalia 2 is better than the original for general casual play, but you'd rather generate value or have a threat in the command zone.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/34/tomik-distinguished-advokist">Tomik, Distinguished Advokist</a> 
If you really, really want to all-in on mono-white Dark Depths then go wild. Alternatively play against a lot of land decks? If white ever becomes a proper secondary lands matters colour then Tomik might pique some more interest.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/30/yomiji-who-bars-the-way">Yomiji, Who Bars the Way</a> 
For Yomiji to be good several things would have to go very right for this specific card, and for Magic card design to return to a more unrefined state where cards like Possessed Portal were good ideas. I'm not particularly sure what exactly would have to be printed, but I can see a world where Yomiji and some cheap flash legendaries and a Possessed Portal lock down a game. Even then, Yomiji costs so much mana and can backfire pretty horrenoudsly to where this is questionable.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/112/zetalpa-primal-dawn">Zetalpa, Primal Dawn</a> 
Zetalpa shouldn't be this high up, but for some reason keyword soup might get enough support some day to where this becomes remotely playable. For now Zetalpa remains a good beater if you can somehow cast it.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/29/sigrid-god-favored">Sigrid, God-Favored</a> 
Like Hixus but one creature and less mana, that can exile creatures in combat no matter where they are going.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/21/reidane-god-of-the-worthy-valkmira-protectors-shield">Reidane, God of the Worthy</a> 
Protects you and your board, might be better than I think at the helm of a Heliod/Ballista deck.

## Tier 5
Explanation of Tier 5

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c20/73/akroma-angel-of-wrath">Akroma, Angel of Wrath</a> 
This is just a big overcosted beater that will die to a variety of things. If there's ever a way to cheat her out every turn then she could be considered.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inv/4/atalya-samite-master">Atalya, Samite Master</a> 
Keep this in Rebecca Guay tribal.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m15/3/avacyn-guardian-angel">Avacyn, Guardian Angel</a> 
Avacyn, Guardian Angel would be alright if she gave protection, but damage prevention is a poor ability especially when it costs this much mana.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/4/baird-steward-of-argive">Baird, Steward of Argive</a> 
Your opponents can attack each other to get attack/combat damage triggers regardless of Baird, and if someone has cast a Craterhoof Behemoth they can run over you with one creature. Mass removal does a better job at protecting you.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lrw/6/brigid-hero-of-kinsbaile">Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaille</a> 
If there's ever a meta where 3 other people are playing 5 mana X/2 commanders with combat damage triggers Baird hard counters those. More realistically just play some more mass removal.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bng/5/brimaz-king-of-oreskos">Brimaz, King of Oreskos</a> 
Brimaz's only merit is generating Skullclamp fodder, but finding a target to attack each turn is difficult since the 1/1 can be blocked, and white can make Skullclamp fodder easily already.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/10e/12/cho-manno-revolutionary">Cho-Manno, Revolutionary</a> 
Even though you can enchant Cho-Manno with Pariah, all you really get out of it is a weird Moat that dies to both enchantment and creature removal.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jud/9/commander-eesha">Commander Eesha</a> 
Effectively evasive and stupendously slow. 2WW for a 2/4 is not where any deck wants to be.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/27/general-jarkeld">General Jarkeld</a> 
I racked my brain and there's nothing to do with Jarkeld.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dde/46/gerrard-capashen">Gerrard Capashen</a> 
Overcosted body with an overcosted ability and useless trinket text.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/me3/12/guan-yu-sainted-warrior">Guan Yu, Sainted Warrior</a> 
There's some interesting combos that can be done with creatures that shuffle themselves in on death, but for now those are not in white.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/hml/8/hazduhr-the-abbot">Hazduhr the Abbot</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/18/hikari-twilight-guardian">Hikari, Twilight Guardian</a> 
I wish this card did something interesting, but mono white can't leverage enters the battlefield triggers as well as green or red can, and Hikari forces you to play cards you otherwise wouldn't. Keep an eye out for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ptk/8/huang-zhong-shu-general">Huang Zhong, Shu General</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/113/isamaru-hound-of-konda">Isamaru, Hound of Konda</a> 
I wouldn't play a 1 mana 3/3 in commander.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cm2/30/jareth-leonine-titan">Jareth, Leonine Titan</a> 
Hard to kill outside of mass removal but that's about it.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/19/kemba-kha-regent">Kemba, Kha Regent</a> 
Your payoff for equipping is making tokens very slowly, which you can't even Skullclamp on their own.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sok/18/kiyomaro-first-to-stand">Kiyomaro, First to Stand</a> 
Cards in hand is not a reliable mechanic, even less so in mono-white.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/chk/30/konda-lord-of-eiganjo">Konda, Lord of Eiganjo</a> 
A 3/3 for 7 is not a fast enough clock.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/20/kongming-sleeping-dragon">Kongming, "Sleeping Dragon"</a> 
I don't consider anthem effects in general very good, and you'd rather have something better in the command zone.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/25/kwende-pride-of-femeref">Kwende, Pride of Femeref</a> 
First strikers are generally pretty small so making them double strike isn't the most threatening thing. There's a small amount of merit to be owed to the fact that he makes on combat damage trigger cards better in a very roundabout way.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/20/linden-the-steadfast-queen">Linden, the Steadfast Queen</a> 
You'd need an easily tutorable permanent or two with the text "Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control." Sadly there are not enough payoffs for Linden to be worth playing. For now keep her in slower Heliod, Sun-Crowned decklists.
#### <a href="">Linvala, the Preserver</a> 
Keep this in Pioneer sideboards.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/me3/19/liu-bei-lord-of-shu">Liu Bei, Lord of Shu</a> 
Not big enough.

#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/chk/33/masako-the-humorless">Masako the Humorless</a> 
The jig is up as soon as you reveal that a combat trick is in the command zone.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/xln/24/mavren-fein-dusk-apostle">Mavren Fein, Dusk Apostle</a> 
Mavrens only merit is generating Skullclamp fodder, but finding a target to attack each turn is difficult and white can make Skullclamp fodder easily already.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/chk/35/myojin-of-cleansing-fire">Myojin of Cleansing Fire</a> 
This doesn't work, and you shouldn't put in the effort to make it work. Wrath of God costs 2WW.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/17/opal-eye-kondas-yojimbo">Opal-Eye, Konda's Yojimbo</a> 
Third option for Samurai storm after Kentaro and Sensei, but two options already exist for that deck and a third, worse one is not needed.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/chk/36/nagao-bound-by-honor">Nagao, Bound by Honor</a> 
The above but even worse.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/21/orim-samite-healer">Orim, Samite Healer</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fut/28/oriss-samite-guardian">Oriss, Samite Guardian</a> 
No but slightly louder.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/18/oyobi-who-split-the-heavens">Oyobi, Who Split the Heavens</a> 
It'd take a minor miracle bu maybe one day there's enough Arcane and Spirit spells that you'd care about this. Keep an eye out for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ptk/14/pang-tong-young-phoenix">Pang Tong, "Young Phoenix"</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bok/19/patron-of-the-kitsune">Patron of the Kitsune</a> 
Lifegain on its own is bad, and 6 is a steep cost. Reducing the cost by offering is foolish as you don't want to play bad foxes in your deck, and the few good foxes are several hundred percent better on the field than Patron.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/39/pianna-nomad-captain">Pianna, Nomad Captain</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c17/69/raksha-golden-cub">Raksha Golden Cub</a> 
Most cats are bad as is this one. 7 mana for a conditional threat is too slow.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/35/rashida-scalebane">Rashida Scalebane</a> 
If you play against 3 Dragon decks feel free to play this.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/hml/12/rashka-the-slayer">Rashka the Slayer</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/143/rick-steadfast-leader">Rick, Steadfast Leader</a> 
Conditional lord that doesn't provide protection. 
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/45/sidar-jabari">Sidar Jabari</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/hml/18/soraya-the-falconer">Soraya the Falconer</a> 
No.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/10/sylvia-brightspear">Sylvia Brightspear</a> 
You'd have to be feeling pretty ironic to play mono-white dragon tribal.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/32/syr-alin-the-lions-claw">Syr Alin, the Lion's Claw</a> 
Anthems shouldn't cost 5 and be tied to attack.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/chk/46/takeno-samurai-general">Takeno, Samurai General</a> 
A big lord for a bad mechanic. Too situational to matter.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/39/taranika-akroan-veteran">Taranika, Akroan Veteran</a> 
Your 3/3 commander will die to most creatures in green.
