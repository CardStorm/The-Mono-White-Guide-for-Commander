# The Mono-White Commander Tierlist
Here is a structured tierlist of all the playable commander(s) in mono-white, with detailed explanations of why they are ranked as they are.
Partners will be rated individually because I'm not going to bother to put 56 combinations on this list, and no, Rograkh is not in mono-white.

## Tier 0
Here would be the commanders that are so good that no other mono-white commander would be even remotely comparable in power level. However for mono-white to have such a commander would require a WWWWW costing creature with an enters the battlefield trigger of 'win the game'.

## Tier 1
Explanation of Tier 1

#### Heliod, Sun-Crowned


#### Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle


## Tier 2
Explanation of Tier 2
These are all commanders I would generally call 'good'. 

#### Darien, King of Kjeldor


#### Sram, Senior Edificer


#### Mangara, the Diplomat


#### Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero


#### God-Eternal Oketra


#### Hokori, Dust Drinker


#### Yosei, the Morning Star


## Tier 3
Explanation of Tier 3

#### Celestial Kirin
Mostly up here because of Ugin's Conjurant being a 0cmc Armageddon, and flexibly mass removal. Awkwardness can happen between spirits in hand and your boardstate, but when Kirin works it feels pretty unfair to your opponents as every card in your hand is removing multiple of their permanents.
#### Bruna, the Fading Light
Recurs two good creature types in the color _on cast_, and can shut off a lot of what your opponents can do if you find Gisela. Only limiting factor is her mana cost, but it's a fair price to pay for the ability to go long and grind out games.
#### Daxos, Blessed by the Sun
Soul sisters combos in commander aren't great but when one piece of the combo is in the command zone the combo looks more appealing. Daxos can only get better with time as new cards get printed.
#### Djeru, With Eyes Open
This gets some of the better cards available in mono-white, and that's it. One of the better commanders to play if you want to cast Triumphant Reckoning.
#### Eight-and-a-Half-Tails
A decent protection ability which can make it hard for your opponents to stop whatever you want to do. Unfortunately this makes the deck very mana-intensive which means sacrifices need to be made in other areas.
#### Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite
Shuts off many decks single-handedly and stops many on-board combos, while making your hate pieces a good bit more threatening since you have an effective +4/+4 anthem for creature combat.
#### Heliod, God of the Sun
Feeds the ever-hungry Skullclamp, lets your beaters and hatepieces beat without you dying in retaliation, and is hard to remove
#### Kentaro, the Smiling Cat
This fixes your mana in a mono-color deck. Play with heavy irony.
On a more serious note, Kentaro goes infinite with fairly little effort but does nothing on his own which is why he's a Tier lower than other combo generals like Lin Sivvi.
#### Sensei Golden-Tail
Same as the above, but tastes different.
#### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri, the Lithomancer</a>
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri</a> does enough interesting things recurring bigger equipments and providing sacrifice fodder for <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/309/smokestack">Smokestack</a> to be a contender.
#### Livio, Oathsworn Sentinel
Livio does a lot of sweet things, though admittedly none are individually particularly powerful. Between reusing enters/leaves the battlefield triggers, protecting your creatures from a boardwipe (in a roundabout way), or setting up combos, Livio is strangely flexible for a white card in a very good way.
#### Rebbec, Architect of Asension
Rebbec has a good ability but currently doesn't have the best home in mono-white as she can make your boardstate awkward between equipment and artifact creatures, both of which are used a good amount of in mono-white. If no such issue exists in the deck then she's the second best partner after Livio.

## Tier 4
Explanation of Tier 4

These are commanders that are strong in specific metas, or have potential to be good in the future but currently lack the ability to consistently do powerful things due to the lack of support. These are by no means well-rounded good commanders, but may be considered.
Even bad partners will be in here as they each have their own merits since there's little opportunity cost to playing them.

#### Akroma, Vision of Ixidor
While Akroma could and should be far better than she is, she's a mana sink that will spook your opponents into playing around her will.
#### Alharu, Solemn Ritualist
With enough +1/+1 support this can become a small engine (if not go infinite) in the command zone as a partner. As it stands Alharu is mostly there to make some tokens that will have incidental synergy with the deck.
#### Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit
If Persist comes back as a mechanic you could fairly easily combo off with Anafenza, but for now this is not true.
#### Ardenn, Intrepid Archaeologist
Best if you can curve an equipment that grants protection into Ardenn, but there's only a handful of such equipment, and you'd be better off ramping early. That said as a partner he can save you mana in the long run by "paying" equip costs even though you can't distribute your equipments as you want.
#### Avacyn, Angel of Hope
While her ability can combine with other cards to end games, her casting cost is so high that your opponents will generally have counterplay to whatever you try to threaten them with.
#### Balan, Wandering Knight
There's a timeline where there are enough cheap and powerful equipment, and ways to dump a bunch into play fast, to where this can do lethal to each opponent very fast. However we do not live in this timeline. That said he is difficult to remove without the use of mass removal as his ability can be activated multiple times to make sure no single target removal connects with him (assuming you have protective equipment in play).
#### Crovax, Ascendant Hero
A worse Elesh Norn is still somewhat decent as Crovax can shut off some on-board creature combos and has the potential to cripple opponents. I can't really see a reason to play this over Elesh Norn other than as an aesthetic choice.
#### Danitha Capashen, Paragon
There might be a weird deck where you storm off with Auras and Equipments some day that involves Danitha Capashen and Sram, but this would require new cards or a Paradox Engine unban. Without this missing enabler she can dump a hand of equipments and auras fast and won't die in combat thanks to first strike.
#### Evra, Halcyon Witness
Evra can kill your opponents very fast given certain conditions, although I wouldn't hold out hope for it.
#### Gisela, the Broken Blade
If there were a fast way to cheat Bruna onto the field then Gisela could be powerful. However white lacks Entomb, and Gisela does not recur creatures like Bruna does so she is the worse option of the pair.
#### Hixus, Prison Warden
Removal in the command zone. In some weird meta of whi Hixus could put in work but for most games you'd rather have something else.
#### Iona, Shield of Emeria
In most cases Iona's effect is mediocre, and hate pieces need to be pretty backbreaking for them to warrant play in the command zone. Even worse is the 6WWW casting cost.
#### Jazal Goldmane
This is a weird Craterhoof Behemoth that can threaten table lethal fairly fast, the issue remains keeping your board intact through Toxic Deluges and Cyclonic Rifts.
#### Kataki, War's Wage
In a completely artifact centric meta, Kataki will wreak havoc. Outside of that you should be playing less situationally good cards in the command zone.
#### Keleth, Sunmane Familiar
The ability does not matter, what matters is that Keleth draws two cards with Skullclamp. Even funnier is that this isn't even that awful, although having access to Rograkh would be much preferred.
#### Kytheon, Hero of Akros
Although Kytheon is sometimes hard to flip, he protects both himself and another creature once he has flipped. Long term he makes some boardstates awkward to interact with as he can force a bad attack, or keep hate pieces alive. That said it's mostly just making things awkward rather than making things impossible for your opponents which would be greatly preferred.
#### Lena, Selfless Champion
Aside from going infinite with Nim Deathmantle, Ashnod's Altar, and two nontoken creatures, Lena protects your hate pieces from most mass removal spells. That said going infinite with Lena is a lot slower than other commander options and her second ability is detrimental to doing a combo as she will cost a whopping 8 mana when you need to recast her.
#### Lieutenant Kirtar
If everyone plays Xenagos, God of Revels then Kirtar can protect you. Or you could play removal and a Moat.
#### Mageta the Lion
Mass removal is one of the best things you can do in mono-white, and Mageta provides that in the command zone. Unforunately discarding two cards is a very steep cost for mono-white.
#### Major Teroh
If everyone else is on black creature decks Teroh is appealing, otherwise don't play this.
#### Mangara of Corondor
Maybe one day there's a very easy way to abuse his effect, but for now it's not easy enough.
#### Michiko Konda, Truth Seeker
Makes it pretty unappealing to hit you.
#### Mikaeus, the Lunarch
I'd like to think that given enough time Mikaeus can shine. Think in the vein of tapping Mikaeus to put counters on Walking Ballista or Hangarback Walker, but in a more meaningful way.
#### Odric, Master Tactician
Forcing favorable blocks can be pretty backbreaking against some decks but this ability doesn't apply to enough decks.
#### Odric, Lunarch Marshal
Odric would be very solid if he always gave his keywordsoup ability, as is he makes combat a bit tricky for your opponents. I'd generally call him worse than the original.
#### Oketra the True
With infinite mana you can make an arbitrarily large board and/or draw your deck. However the ways of achieving this are few, of which none are particularly excellent. On her own Oketra2 presents a threat as she wields most equipment well, and can generate a large amount of card advantage very fast if no one can block or remove her. She also eventually kills your opponents which matters less.
#### Prava of the Steel Legion
Similar to Oketra2, if you want to make infinite mana this is one of the few outlets in the command zone. Whereas Oketra2 can wield equipment by herself, Prava is a partner which allows you to select a different angle for your deck building with a partner of your choice.
#### Radiant, Archangel
If you could get 18 fliers onto the board turn 4 and swing for lethal on turn 5 we might be talking. As is this is very difficult to achieve realistically. Even without that Radiant gets large without much effort and presents an evasive clock on your opponents.
#### Radiant, Serra Archangel
This is a partner option and having an extra card you can always cast, even if the card is bad, is still relevant. Radiant is also an evasive threat and has some of the best protection in the game for very little extra effort.
#### Regna, the Redeemer
In theory Regna makes 8 tokens a turn cycle, which means a lot of cards drawn with Skullclamp. Unfortunately the mana cost is a bit steep for what is a value generator.
#### Reya Dawnbringer
A very expensive slow value engine. There are metas where this is pretty good but those are far and few between.
#### Rune-Tail, Kitsune Asendant
Makes combat impossible for your opponents when involving you, but ultimately is less useful than it seems.
#### Sephara, Sky's Blade
Big threat for a cheap cost that protects some of your hate pieces from some removal.
#### Thalia, Guardian of Thraben
Maybe for very degenerate but unrefined metas. Realistically if this card is a good inclusion to face your meta then you should be playing Heliod or Teshar instead and play this in there.
#### Thalia, Heretic Cathar
Thalia 2 is better than the original for general casual play, but you'd rather generate value or have a threat in the command zone.
#### Tomik, Distinguished Advokist
If you really, really want to all-in on mono-white Dark Depths then go wild. Alternatively play against a lot of land decks? If white ever becomes a proper secondary lands matters colour then Tomik might pique some more interest.
#### Yomiji, Who Bars the Way
For Yomiji to be good several things would have to go very right for this specific card, and for Magic card design to return to a more unrefined state where cards like Possessed Portal were printed. I'm not particularly sure what exactly would have to be printed, but I can see a world where Yomiji and some cheap flash legendaries and a Possessed Portal lock down a game. Even then, Yomiji costs so much mana and can backfire pretty horrenoudsly to where this is questionable.
#### Zetalpa, Primal Dawn
Zetalpa shouldn't be this high up, but for some reason keyword soup might get enough support some day to where this becomes remotely playable. For now Zetalpa remains a good beater if you can somehow cast it.

## Tier 5
Explanation of Tier 5

#### Akroma, Angel of Wrath
This is just a big overcosted beater that will die to a variety of things. If there's ever a way to cheat her out every turn then she could be considered.
#### Atalya, Samite Master
Keep this in Rebecca Guay tribal.
#### Avacyn, Guardian Angel
Avacyn, Guardian Angel would be alright if she gave protection, but damage prevention is a poor ability especially when it costs this much mana.
#### Baird, Steward of Argive
Your opponents can attack each other to get attack/combat damage triggers regardless of Baird, and if someone has cast a Craterhoof Behemoth they can run over you with one creature. Mass removal does a better job at protecting you.
#### Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaille
If there's ever a meta where 3 other people are playing 5 mana X/2 commanders with combat damage triggers Baird hard counters those. More realistically just play some more mass removal.
#### Brimaz, King of Oreskos
Brimaz's only merit is generating Skullclamp fodder, but finding a target to attack each turn is difficult since the 1/1 can be blocked, and white can make Skullclamp fodder easily already.
#### Cho-Manno, Revolutionary
Even though you can enchant Cho-Manno with Pariah, all you really get out of it is a weird Moat that dies to both enchantment and creature removal.
#### Commander Eesha
Effectively evasive and stupendously slow. 2WW for a 2/4 is not where any deck wants to be.
#### General Jarkeld
I racked my brain and there's nothing to do with Jarkeld.
#### Gerrard Capashen
Overcosted body with an overcosted ability and useless trinket text.
#### Guan Yu, Sainted Warrior
There's some interesting combos that can be done with creatures that shuffle themselves in on death, but for now those are not in white.
#### Hazduhr the Abbot
No.
#### Hikari, Twilight Guardian
I wish this were did something interesting, but mono white can't leverage enters the battlefield triggers as well as green or red can, and Hikari forces you to play cards you otherwise wouldn't. Keep an eye out for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.
#### Huang Zhong, Shu General
No.
#### Isamaru, Hound of Konda
I wouldn't play a 1 mana 3/3 in commander.
#### Jareth, Leonine Titan
Hard to kill outside of mass removal but that's about it.
#### Kemba, Kha Regent
Your payoff for equipping is making tokens very slowly, which you can't even Skullclamp on their own.
#### Kiyomaro, First to Stand
Cards in hand is not a reliable mechanic, even less so in mono-white.
#### Konda, Lord of Eiganjo
A 3/3 for 7 is not a fast enough clock.
#### Kongming, "Sleeping Dragon"
I don't consider anthem effects in general very good, and you'd rather have something better in the command zone.
#### Kwende, Pride of Femeref
First strikers are generally pretty small so making them double strike isn't the most threatening thing. There's a small amount of merit to be owed to the fact that he makes on combat damage trigger cards better in a very roundabout way.
#### Linden, the Steadfast Queen
You'd need an easily tutorable permanent or two with the text "Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control." Archangel of Thune is currently the only one and is hard to search for. For now keep her in more slower Heliod, Sun-Crowned decklists.
#### Linvala, the Preserver
Keep this in Pioneer sideboards.
#### Liu Bei, Lord of Shu
Not big enough.
#### Lyra Dawnbringer
The comparison to Liesa, Shroud of Dusk makes this card look laughable.
#### Masako the Humorless
The jig is up as soon as you reveal that a combat trick is in the command zone.
#### Mavren Fein, Dusk Apostle
Mavrens only merit is generating Skullclamp fodder, but finding a target to attack each turn is difficult and white can make Skullclamp fodder easily already.
#### Myojin of Cleansing Fire
This doesn't work, and you shouldn't put in the effort to make it work. Wrath of God costs 2WW.
#### Opal-Eye, Konda's Yojimbo
Third option for Samurai storm after Kentaro and Sensei, but two options already exist for that deck and a third, worse one is not needed.
#### Nagao, Bound by Honor
The above but even worse.
#### Orim, Samite Healer
No.
#### Oriss, Samite Guardian
No but slightly lowder.
#### Oyobi, Who Split the Heavens
It'd take a minor miracle bu maybe one day there's enough Arcane and Spirit spells that you'd care about this. Keep an eye out for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.
#### Pang Tong, "Young Phoenix"
No.
#### Patron of the Kitsune
Lifegain on its own is bad, and 6 is a steep cost. Reducing the cost by offering is foolish as you don't want to play bad foxes in your deck, and the few good foxes are several hundred percent better on the field than Patron.
#### Pianna, Nomad Captain
No.
#### Raksha Golden Cub
Most cats are bad as is this one. 7 mana for a conditional threat is too slow.
#### Rashida Scalebane
If you play against 3 Dragon decks feel free to play this.
#### Rashka the Slayer
No.
#### Rick, Steadfast Leader
Conditional lord that doesn't provide protection. 
#### Sidar Jabari
No.
#### Soraya the Falconer
No.
#### Sylvia Brightspear
You'd have to be feeling pretty ironic to play mono-white dragon tribal.
#### Syr Alin, the Lion's Claw
Anthems shouldn't cost 5 and be tied to attack.
#### Takeno, Samurai General
A big lord for a bad mechanic. Too situational to matter.
#### Taranika, Akroan Veteran
Your 3/3 commander will die to most creatures in green.
#### Tivadar of Thorn
Maybe if you play against 3 Krenko decks and the pilots haven't found ways to give Krenko haste.
#### Trynn, Champion of Freedom
Mavren Fein that is a bit less bad but is still bad.
#### Zhang Fei, Fierce Warrior
Not big enough.
#### Zhao Zilong
Not big enough.
#### Zuberi, Golden Feather
Conditional lord that doesn't provide protection.
