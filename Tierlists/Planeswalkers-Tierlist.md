# The Mono-White Planeswalker Tierlist
Here is a structured tierlist of all the playable planeswalkers in mono-white, with detailed explanations of why they are ranked as they are.

//
Cards are generally rated in a vaccuum without consideration of other cards; however some cards are rated with an * next to them, indicating where a card might be far better than rated due to being highly synergistic and/or being part of a package.
//

 ## Tier 0
Here would be meta-defining and oppressively good cards. Think of Dockside Extortionist and Thassa's Oracle.

There are none as of now.

## Tier 1
Great cards that can find a home in most decks.



## Tier 2
Good cards that will find a home in a many decks.



## Tier 3
Average and reasonable cards that can be slotted into a deck without much issue.

As many white decks can be made to gain a non-trivial amount of life without too much work, this is efficient one-sided mass removal. However the sacrifice of playing ways to gain life must still be made to include <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/2/ajani-strength-of-the-pride">Ajani</a>, causing the deck to suffer elsewhere.

## Tier 4
Suboptimal cards that have specific utility or synergy. These cards are cards you don't really want to play but sometimes have to.

##### Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants
As a way to bring 2 cmc creatures back this is one of the better ways to keep doing it. That said this idea hasn't really materialized in mono-white commander decks yet.
##### Ajani Steadfast
Eventually WotC will print enough powerful planeswalker support to where superfriends is considerablein mono-white. *Eventually*.



## Tier 5
Bad cards that occasionally have niche applications due to synergy overlap.

##### Ajani, Caller of the Pride
3 mana isn't too much mana to pay if you can delete someone or get extra on combat damage triggers, but there aren't too many ways to make this card worthwhile.


## Tier 6
Aside from being aesthetic choices or incredibly specific cards in very bad combos, these cards should never be included in a deck if the intent is to build a good deck.

##### Ajani Goldmane


##### Ajani, Inspiring Leader
For 1 more mana you could cast Luminarch Primordial and exile something from each opponent.
