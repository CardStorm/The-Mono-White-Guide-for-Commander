# The Mono-White Planeswalker Tierlist
Here is a structured tierlist of all the playable planeswalkers in mono-white, with detailed explanations of why they are ranked as they are.

//
Cards are generally rated in a vaccuum without consideration of other cards; however some cards are rated with an * next to them, indicating where a card might be far better than rated due to being highly synergistic and/or being part of a package.
//

 ## Tier 0
Cards you should play in every deck without exception, barring extreme circumstances.

Currently there are no planeswalkers that could be considered must-haves in mono-white.

## Tier 1
Great cards that can find a home in most decks. You should find a way to include these in your deck if possible.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/1/ugin-the-spirit-dragon">Ugin, the Spirit Dragon</a> 
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/1/ugin-the-spirit-dragon">Big Ugin</a> is a prime search target for <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/23/arena-rector">Arena Rector</a>. Many games have been ended by a turn three <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/1/ugin-the-spirit-dragon">Ugin</a> as it'll either clear the board and demand an answer, or stick and make utility creatures unplayable while threatening to put you very far ahead.

## Tier 2
Good cards that will find a home in a many decks, but are not necessarily impactful in every meta.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ddo/1/elspeth-suns-champion">Elspeth, Sun's Champion</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/1/karn-the-great-creator">Karn, the Great Creator</a> 
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/1/karn-the-great-creator">Karn</a> is a one-sided <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/wth/154/null-rod">Null Rod</a>. Seeing as mono-white is always to some extent reliant on artifacts, not shutting off our own

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/2/ugin-the-ineffable">Ugin, the Ineffable</a> 
While it's occasionally awkward to land a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/2/ugin-the-ineffable">small Ugin</a> safely, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/2/ugin-the-ineffable">Ugin</a> does a great job of making sacrifice fodder, bodies to protect your planeswalkers, bodies to wield equipment, removing problems, and getting card advantage.

## Tier 3
Average and reasonable cards that can be slotted into a deck without much issue.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/2/ajani-strength-of-the-pride">Ajani, Strength of the Pride</a>
As many white decks can be made to gain a non-trivial amount of life without too much work, this is efficient one-sided mass removal. However the sacrifice of playing ways to gain life must still be made to include <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/2/ajani-strength-of-the-pride">Ajani</a>, causing the deck to suffer elsewhere.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/1/karn-scion-of-urza">Karn, Scion of Urza</a> 
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dom/1/karn-scion-of-urza">Karn</a> draws you a card each turn and can defend itself, but in highly synergistic decks an important card might be exiled permanently. Best in goodstuff decks that have little care for synergy.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri, the Lithomancer</a> 
Equipments are some of the best cards in mono-white, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri</a> can bring them back or provide a body to attach them to. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/26/nahiri-the-lithomancer">Nahiri</a> can also break parity on cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/309/smokestack">Smokestack</a>.


## Tier 4
Suboptimal cards that have specific utility or synergy. These cards are cards you don't really want to play but sometimes have to.
Many of the planeswalkers here are waiting

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m19/3/ajani-adversary-of-tyrants">Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants</a> 
As a way to bring 2 cmc creatures back this is one of the better ways to keep doing it. That said this idea hasn't really materialized in mono-white commander decks yet.
##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m15/1/ajani-steadfast">Ajani Steadfast</a>
Eventually WotC will print enough powerful planeswalker support to where superfriends is considerable in mono-white. *Eventually*.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mma/13/elspeth-knight-errant">Elspeth, Knight Errant</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/18/gideon-ally-of-zendikar">Gideon, Ally of Zendikar</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/e01/10/gideon-jura">Gideon Jura</a> 
A reasonable filler card that forces awkward attacks and can remove creatures.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/1/karn-liberated">Karn Liberated</a> 
In a deck that approaches superfriends <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/1/karn-liberated">Karn</a> will drain resources. I'd wait for more planeswalker support unless you're very committed to the idea already.


## Tier 5
Bad cards that occasionally have niche applications due to synergy overlap.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m14/1/ajani-caller-of-the-pride">Ajani, Caller of the Pride</a>
3 mana isn't too much mana to pay if you can delete someone or get extra on combat damage triggers, but there aren't too many ways to make this card worthwhile.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/som/6/elspeth-tirel">Elspeth Tirel</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/13/gideon-blackblade">Gideon Blackblade</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/14/gideon-of-the-trials">Gideon of the Trials *</a> 
Gideon is only really a consideration in stopping degenerate combos that ignore your boardstate such as <a href="">Thassa's Oracle</a>+<a href="">Demonic Consultation</a> and <a href="">Aetherflux Reservoir</a>. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/14/gideon-of-the-trials">Gideon</a> is quite good at stopping those but outside of that lacks any real utility.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/32/teyo-the-shieldmage">Teyo, the Shieldmage</a> 
There aren't too many ways to give yourself hexproof, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/32/teyo-the-shieldmage">Teyo</a> is easily searchable and protects himself. You'd only really want this for against a specific deck though.
##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/37/the-wanderer">The Wanderer</a> 
On paper this is a two-for-one, but is on the far low end of playables. A consideration for superfriends but you'd have to be a bit desparate.



## Tier 6
Aside from being aesthetic choices or incredibly specific cards in very bad combos, these planeswalkers should never be included in a deck if the intent is to build a functional deck.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m11/1/ajani-goldmane">Ajani Goldmane</a>


##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m20/282/ajani-inspiring-leader">Ajani, Inspiring Leader</a>
For 1 more mana you could cast Luminarch Primordial and exile something from each opponent.

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m19/281/ajani-wise-counselor">Ajani, Wise Counselor</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/320/basri-devoted-paladin">Basri, Devoted Paladin</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/7/basri-ket">Basri Ket</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/14/elspeth-suns-nemesis">Elspeth, Sun's Nemesis</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/270/elspeth-undaunted-hero">Elspeth, Undaunted Hero</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/gtc/13/gideon-champion-of-justice">Gideon, Champion of Justice</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/270/gideon-martial-paragon">Gideon, Martial Paragon</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/265/gideon-the-oathsworn">Gideon, the Oathsworn</a> 

##### <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/26/serra-the-benevolent">Serra the Benevolent</a> 
<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/26/serra-the-benevolent">Serra</a> is unfortunately just a worse <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/akh/14/gideon-of-the-trials">Gideon of the Trials</a>.
