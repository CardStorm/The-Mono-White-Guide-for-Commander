# The Mono-White Sorcery Tierlist
 Here is a structured tierlist of all the playable sorceries in mono-white, with detailed explanations of why they are ranked as they are.

 ## Tier 0
Here would be meta-defining and oppressively good cards. Think of Dockside Extortionist and Thassa's Oracle.

There are none as of now.

## Tier 1
Great cards that can find a home in most decks.

## Tier 2
Good cards that will find a home in a many decks.

## Tier 3
Average and reasonable cards that can be slotted into a deck without much issue.

## Tier 4
Suboptimal cards that have specific utility or synergy. These cards are cards you don't really want to play but sometimes have to.

## Tier 5
Bad cards that occasionally have niche applications due to synergy overlap.

## Tier 6
Aside from being aesthetic choices or incredibly specific cards in very bad combos, these cards should never be included in a deck if the intent is to build a good deck.
